For this project, we are required to develop a transfger learning algorithm. We initially tried to train a neural Network composed of encoder layers and predictor layers. We trained both layer sets on the LUMO Energy set. To transfer to the HOMO-LUMO gap, we froze the encoder layers and retrained the predictor on the HOMO-LUMO gap dataset. However, seeing that this was not the best solution, we concluded that the encoder failed to encode the key features of the data in low dimensions.
We therefore chose to train an auto encoder-decoder network. Then, freezing the encoder, we first trained a neural network on the bigger dataset, before continuing the training on the reduced data set. Note that to avoid overfitting on the HOMO-LUMO gap, we added a dropout probability when transfering the training. This allows to avoid training every layer fully to the smaller set at every epoch.
