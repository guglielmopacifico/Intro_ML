For this task, we were faced with 3 issues: data imputation, feature selection and the regression itself. For the data imputation, we chose to replace nan values by the mean over all patients of the missing measure. While this may not be the most accurate imputation, we prioritised it over other techniques such as k nearest neighbours for its lower runtime. For the feature selection, we observed that what was interesting for all sub-tasks was the variation and extremes of the data over the stay of the patient: if this data fluctuates massively, it may be interesting to order a test for that; if this other data is unusually large, maybe the patient is exposed to a sepsis... We also thought that the absence of measurement characterised a conscious choice not to measure this data, hence should be taken into the diagnostic. This is why each feature measurement values over time where transformed into their mean, median, min, max and number of measurements taken over the 12 hour period.
The now very high number of features was then reduced by only selecting the 40 new features which are most correlated to the output label.
As for the models chosen, we chose for each label in sub-tasks 1 and 2 a linear kernel SVM and applied the sigmoid function to the decision function of the trained SVM to predict real values in [0,1]. For task 3, we used a Ridge regression for each label, with cross-validated regularisation parameters.
